# Cooking Recipe

**s’more pie**

*Lngredients*

###### *For crust*

* 5 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, melted, plus additional for greasing
* 1 1/2 cups cookie crumbs (10 graham crackers or 24 small gingersnaps; about 6 oz, pulsed in a food processor until finely ground)
* 2 tablespoons sugar
 * 1/8 teaspoon salt (omitted if you use salted butter)


###### *For chocolate cream filling*

* 7 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not more than 70% cacao; not unsweetened), finely chopped
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 large egg, at room temperature for 30 minutes

###### *For marshmallow topping*
* 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (from a 1/4-oz package)
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup light corn syrup
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* Vegetable oil for greasing


*kitchen tools*

* teaspoons
* tablespoons
* cup
* candy thermometer 
* food processor


*steps of the recipe*

Make graham cracker crust: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter pie 9- to 9 1/2-inch pie plate. Stir together all ingredients in a bowl and press evenly on bottom and up side of pie plate. Bake until crisp, 12 to 15 minutes, then cool on a rack to room temperature, about 45 minutes.

Make chocolate cream filling: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Put chocolate in a large bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then pour hot cream over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Gently whisk in egg and a pinch of salt until combined and pour into graham cracker crumb crust (crust will be about half full).

Cover edge of pie with a pie shield or foil and bake until filling is softly set and trembles slightly in center when gently shaken, about 25 minutes. Cool pie to room temperature on a rack (filling will firm as it cools), about 1 hour.

Make marshmallow topping: Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a large deep heatproof bowl and let stand until softened, about 1 minute.

Stir together sugar, corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and remaining 1/4 cup water in cleaned 1- to 1 1/4-quart heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil until thermometer registers 260°F, about 6 minutes.

Begin beating water and gelatin mixture with an electric mixer at medium speed, then carefully pour in hot syrup in a slow stream, beating (avoid beaters and side of bowl). When all of syrup is added, increase speed to high and continue beating until mixture is tripled in volume and very thick, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla and beat until combined, then immediately spoon topping onto center of pie filling; it will slowly spread to cover top of pie. Chill, uncovered, 1 hour, then cover loosely with lightly oiled plastic wrap (oiled side down) and chill 3 hours more.

Brown topping: Preheat broiler. Transfer pie to a baking sheet. Cover edge of pie with pie shield or foil and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat, rotating pie as necessary, until marshmallow topping is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Cool pie on a rack 10 minutes. Slice pie with a large heavy knife dipped in hot water and then dried with a towel before cutting each slice.



**There is not a special season of the year for s’more pie**

*Alternately*

"I browned the topping with a creme brulee torch. It took some time and didn’t get as brown as I think it would have under the broiler (the pie was still cold, and hard to heat up with a small flame) but it does work in a pinch, or when you’re away from the oven."



# Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\mathbf{pq}}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if $p = (p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and $q = (q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$d(\mathbf{p,q}) = d(q,p)=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2}$$
                                 $$=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}$$
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector
$$||P|| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ...p_n^2} = \sqrt{P*P}$$
where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from p to q), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by
$$ q-p = (q_1-p_1,q_2-p_2,...,q_n-p_n). $$
In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from **p** to **q**. In any space it can be regarded as the position of **q** relative to **p**. It may also be called a displacement vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between p and q is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:
             $$||q-p|| = \sqrt{(q-p) *(q-p)} .$$ 
which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:
     $$||q-p|| = \sqrt{||p||^2 + ||q||^2 - 2p*q} .$$
